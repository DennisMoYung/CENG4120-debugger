# CENG4120 debugger
This project is developed for CENG4120 hw2, which is used to generate random PCN cube list and convert it back to somthing that online tool can be read.

## generator.py
For this part, it is used to generat some random PCN cube for diplay, no duplicate row will be founded inside of the list. The first row is m (width) and the second row is n (height). Since the online tools only can display 24 upper letter (without T and F), so the **maximum** of m(width) should be 24. Beside this, since it will removes the duplicate row generated by itself, please set the n value a little bit bigger if you need
```
python generator.py
```


## convert.cpp
For this part, thank for the [online truth table generator](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/) , so that we can keep having the process. If you are in linux system, please check g++ compiler has been installed in your computer by 
```
g++ --version
```
If not showing the version information, then please enter:
```
sudo apt update

sudo apt install build-essential
```
This converter will convert the list into somthing that the online generator can read. We just need to entering the path of input and output directory, for example:
```
./convert test_in.txt convert_in.txt
./convert test_out.txt convert_out.txt
```
After that, we can copy both of the source and result expression to the [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/) . Just copy the table to a txt and comparing is there any different between two truth tables by using others tools. If they are the same, congrats!
